          The task of creating a better world for veterans is not one we can accomplish alone. So, we're calling on you to become a volunteer for the organization, to become one of <em>Zola’s Warriors</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As one of Zola’s Warriors, we would ask of you to represent our organization at other veteran outreach events across the country and to be a local contact in your community should any veterans in your area be in need of any kind of assistance.

          Zola knew that. He wanted to stimulate the community and to create a better world for veterans. In his memory, we aim to accomplish that.
        </p>
        <p>By signing up and providing us with your contact information, you will be provided with a free Zola Initiative t-shirt.  Should you decide to represent our organization at any events, you will be provided with all materials necessary for the event.</p>
